<h2>What is the Bitcoin Halving?</h2>
<p>New bitcoins are issued by the Bitcoin network every 10 minutes. For the first four years of Bitcoin's existence, the amount of new bitcoins issued every 10 minutes was 50. Every four years, this number is cut in half. The day the reward halve is called a "halving"</p> 

<p>In 2012, the amount of new bitcoins issued every 10 minutes dropped from 50 bitcoins to 25. In 2016, it dropped from 25 to 12.5. Now, in the 2020 halving, it will drop from 12.5 to 6.25.</p> 

<h2>What is the Significance of the Reward Halving?</h2>
<p>The halving decreases the amount of new bitcoins generated per block. This means the supply of Bitcoin is lower.</p>
<p>In normal markets, lower supply with steady demand usually leads to higher prices. Since the halving does not reduce the supply of bitcoins, and demand usually remains steady, the halving has usually preceded some of Bitcoin's largest runs. </p>

<p>In the image below, the vertical green lines indicate the previous two halvings (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply">2012-11-28 and 2016-7-9</a>). Note how the price has jumped significantly after each halving.</p>

<h2>So, the Halvings Affect Bitcoin's Inflation?</h2>
<p>Yes, the halvings lower Bitcoin's inflation rate.</p>

<p>In the image below, you can see Bitcoin's inflation rate during each period. </p>

<h2>Bitcoin Halving Schedule</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin halving is scheduled in block height, not date.</p>

<p>The reward halves every 210,000 blocks. The 2020 halving will happen on block 630,000. 2024 will happen at block 840,000.</p>

<h2>What Happens to Miners During Halvings?</h2>
<p>Many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/09/the-reward-for-mining-bitcoin-was-just-cut-in-half/">always speculate</a> that miners will shut down after the halving. The reality is most miners are very smart and price in the halving, so they don't end up shutting down any miners.</p>

<h2>When is the Next Bitcoin Halving, after the 2020 Halving?</h2>
<p>The 2024 halving will likely occur between March 2024 and June 2024. </p>

<h2>Bitcoin Halving History</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Halving_day_2012">2012 block halving</a> was the first one. It was mined by SlushPool by someone using a Radeon HD 5800. </p>

<h2>Current Bitcoin Block Reward</h2>
<p>The current Bitcoin block reward is 12.5 bitcoins per block. When block 630,000 is hit in 2020, the reward will drop to 6.25 bitcoins (BTC) per block.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Halving Parties</h2>
<p>Thousands of Bitcoiners across the world celebrated the 2016 halving. There <a href="http://blog.thehalvening.com/bitcoin-halving-parties-2016/">were parties</a> in tons of major cities like Buenos Aires, Melbourne, Montreal, Paris, Athens, Dublin and dozens of other cities.</p>

<p>Here is a video from the 2016 halving party in Tel Aviv:</p>

<h2>Is There an Ethereum Block Reward Halving Countdown? </h2>
<p>Ethereum's block reward does not halve like bitcoins, so there is no countdown.</p>
